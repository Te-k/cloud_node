Blockade.io Cloud Node
======================
Blockade is able to provide blocking capabilities within the Chrome browser by using a cloud backend controlled by trusted analysts. Blockade subscribes to the "serverless_" concept and uses nothing but Amazon Web Services (AWS_) for all its functionality. This repository is a placeholder for the scripts to re-create the cloud node in any AWS environment. To learn more about Blockade, visit the project page_.
